# Overview

This document serves as a **user manual** for the **AVI → TIFF Conversion Panel**, a Shiny module that allows users to convert `.avi` video files into `.tiff` image frame sequences.  

The panel provides a **graphical interface** for selecting folders containing `.avi` files, running conversions using **FFmpeg**, and viewing conversion logs in real time.
